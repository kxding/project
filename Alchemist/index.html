            Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. 
            However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. 
            <span style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation.</span> 
            Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. 
            Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. 
            <span style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">To this end, we propose Alchemist, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs.</span> 
            Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. 
            <span style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception.</span> <span style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">
            We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training.</span> 
            <span style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training.</span> <span style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance.</span> <span style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.</span>

                Overall pipeline of Alchemist. In the initial data rating stage (a), the rater predicts a classification score for each image based
                on gradient extracted from a T2I proxy model. The rater and the proxy model are jointly optimized through weighted loss and total loss. In
                the data pruning stage (b), we introduce the Shift-Gsample strategy to efficiently retain informative samples while filtering out redundant
                data and outliers. The resulting Alchemist-selected dataset enables highly efficient training of downstream text-to-image models.
